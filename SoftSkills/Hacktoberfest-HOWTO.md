# Hacktoberfest: Tidying up your GitHub repos for guests!

## Format
Regular Session

## Abstract
GitHub can be wonderful, especially during Hacktoberfest. Prepare your repos for the fun!

## Description
Hacktoberfest is a unique time of year that brings new folks to open source repositories on GitHub in October, lured in by the promises of comfy t-shirts.

However, special care should be given to minimize confusion and frustration in issue creation in order to encourage folks to help you out instead of someone else.

Behold some best practices for creating issues, so that people give useful PRs in response.

This talk will contain tips for two sets of folks: 
- Repo owners that create issues
- Potential contributors to open source projects, whether they be potential first-timers or veterans.

You will leave with strategies to maximize your Hacktoberfests, and your open source repositories in general!
