# Hacktoberfest: How to get other people to do your work

## Format
Regular Session

## Abstract
GitHub can be wonderful, especially during Hacktoberfest. Get ready to hit the ground running!

## Description
Best practices for creating issues that encourage people to give useful PRs in response. Because Hacktoberfest is a unique time of year that brings new folks to open source repositories, special care should be given to minimize confusion and frustration in issue creation.

This talk will contain tips for two sets of folks: 
- Repo owners that create issues
- Hacktoberfest participants that want to use the allure of a comfy free t-shirt to try out contributing to open source.



## Audience
Who is the audience?
Developers, or anyone else that wants to collaborate on GitHub, especially during Hacktoberfest in October of each year.
Knowledge of GitHub is helpful here.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come away with?
After listening to this talk, you will gain insights about yourself and your co-workers, and you will learn how to be a better person, employee, and advocate for others.

## Outline
This presentation covers several topics:
- A brief introduction to Hacktoberfest
- Describing a possible contributor to your repo
- Describing a good issue, and why it's more likely to be completed

## Mind Map
- TBD, but there is a repo that I created last hacktoberfest about this: https://github.com/zo0o0ot/hacktoberfest-issue-howto
