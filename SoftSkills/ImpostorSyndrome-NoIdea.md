## Format
Google Slides

## Abstract
Hear about Impostor Syndrome from a software developer with a Psychology degree.

In this talk, you will learn what Impostor Syndrome is, why it matters in todayâ€™s workplace, and strategies for conquering it. You will learn ways to be an advocate for others in tech, from people who are just considering a career to long-time industry veterans.

After listening to this talk, you will gain insights about yourself and your co-workers, and you will learn how to be a better person, employee, and advocate for others.

This presentation was created with Google Slides. A PDF version is available on this page, but you if you want, can look at my presenter notes here.

I created a Medium article with some of the resources I collected while researching this session. Feel free to check that out here.

## Description
We all have hobbies we like to do when we leave the office, but that doesn't mean we have to shut down our programmer minds at the end of the day. I love to crochet in my spare time and in many cases, the approach to crafting is the same as coding. You wouldn't believe how similar writing a crochet pattern is to writing code. There are hardware requirements, different languages, loops, methods, and modeling diagrams.

In this talk, I'll show how reading and writing crochet patterns uses many of the same fundamental principles as coding, complete with Ruby code samples and personal crochet samples. You will walk away thinking about coding principles and their applications beyond your screen. You might even become interested in learning to crochet!

## Audience
Who is the audience for?
Anyone interested in thinking about code in the real world beyond the digital plane.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come
away with?
After this talk, the audience will have their interest piqued and learn a little about how writing a pattern is like writing code.
