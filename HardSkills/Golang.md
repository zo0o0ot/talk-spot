## How About a Go?

## Format
Regular session

## Short Abstract
Go: A beginner’s perspective. 

## Description
What’s the Google Go language (Golang) really good for? Is it “worth a go”? Ease of deployment, simple syntax, and native concurrency make for strong arguments! 

You will hear about Go from a beginner’s point of view. No Go experience is necessary. You will learn more about Go, and leave with a better idea of whether Go is a language that you should learn and use in either personal or business projects. 

## Audience
*Who is the audience?*
Anyone who is interested in Golang (probably developers).

## Outcomes/Conclusions
Learning about Golang and some possible projects to do.
