# Coding inside the web browser! Talking about GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod.

## Format
Regular Session

## Short Abstract
Is the Dark programming language a new way of thinking about code, or a gimmick?

## Description
As cloud resources and source code management tools improve in quality and affordability over time, the days of needing a dedicated development machine may no longer be necessary for all development workflows.

This is a discussion on developing in the browser, with me showing several examples of projects that I've worked on in Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces.

I will then give some instructions on how to set up your own cloud development environment!

## Audience
Who is the audience?
Developers, or people who would be interested in starting to code inside of a web browser.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come away with?
- Gain a better understanding of cloud-based development in the web browser.
- Know the questions to ask and the steps to take to get started coding in the web. 

## Outline
- History of coding in the web
- Different categories of web coding products
- Showing off the big two: Codespaces and Gitpod.
- Live demos: GitHub Codespaces and GitPod
- Quesstions?
