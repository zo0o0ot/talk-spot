# Coming out of the Dark: An introduction to Darklang

## Format
Regular Session

## Short Abstract
Is the Dark programming language a new way of thinking about code, or a gimmick?

## Description
Would you like coding to be 100X less complicated? Thatâ€™s what the Dark programming language claims to do.  Currently in private beta, Dark is a new way of thinking about back-end development.

By the end of this session, you will know more about Dark, see the Dark programming environment, and determine and whether it is something that could work for your needs.

## Audience
Who is the audience?
Developers, or people who would be interested in starting to code with a new language.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come away with?
Determine if Dark is useful for you to use as a programming language.
