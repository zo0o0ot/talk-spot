# Getting (.NET) interactive!

## Format
Regular Session

## Short Abstract
Is .NET Interactive a new way of thinking about code, or a gimmick?

## Description
In the past, tools like Jupyter notebooks have allowed folks to create interactive, shareable data experiences using languages like Python and R.  However, with .NET 6, you now have the interactivity and ease of combining markdown and executable code cells to create interesting and novel experiences with your existing .NET skills.

During this session, I will introduce .NET notebooks and show you some of the things that they can do.  I will then show you an example of .NET interactive in action, and provide some suggestions on how you can use .NET Interactive in your projects!

## Audience
Who is the audience?
Experience with markdown and .NET would be handy, but .NET Interactive may be a good way for you to learn .NET if you're interested in checking it out!
