# Creating a professional portfolio site: From zero to deployed with Hugo and GitHub Pages.

## Format
Full-day Workshop

## Short Abstract
Don't have a portfolio site that shows who you are? Make one today with Hugo!

## Description
Personal portfolio websites can give you an added presence on the Internet, giving you a place to show off work that you're proud of.  It's also an easy way to allow people to connect to you and the work that you do.

Given the magic of Hugo's static site generation framework, as well as free tools such as Gitpod, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Pages, we can start from scratch and make your professional profile website in less than a day!  Let's do it together!

## Audience
Who is the audience?
Developers, or people who would be interested in creating a professional profile website.
- General familiarity with GitHub and Markdown are useful.
- A GitHub account (or the desire to create one)
- Access to a computer, as this is a session where we will all make sites together.
- If you want to make lots of customizations, knowledge of CSS, Javascript, and golang are nice (but not required)

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come away with?
This is for programmer folks that want to make a nice, mostly automated profile page for personal or professional use.  The goal is for someone to come in with the idea and leave with a working site.

## Why Me?
I've created a variety of websites using Hugo, including three professional profile pages, and I found them to be surprisingly accessible.

I'm also going to use my expertise with Gitpod and GitHub actions to help folks create a free browser-based online IDE with a preview of the portfolio site, as well as integrated Github Actions that allow you to automatically deploy your site changes to GitHub Pages.

I think that this sort of activity is a great activity for a conference, especially a pre-conference.  It gives people a positive learning experience and something to possibly share with other folks as they network during the conference.
