# Creating a professional portfolio site: From zero to deployed with Hugo and GitHub Pages.

## Format
Half-day Workshop

## Short Abstract
Don't have a portfolio site that shows who you are? Make one today with Hugo!

## Description
Personal portfolio websites can give you an added presence on the Internet, giving you a place to show off work that you're proud of.  It's also an easy way to allow people to connect to you and the work that you do.

Given the magic of Hugo's static site generation framework and GitHub pages, we can start from scratch and make your professional profile website in less than a day!  Let's do it together!

## Audience
Who is the audience?
Developers, or people who would be interested in creating a professional profile website.
- General familiarity with GitHub and Markdown are useful.
- A GitHub account (or the desire to create one)
- Access to a computer, as this is a session where we will all make sites together.
- If you want to make lots of customizations, knowledge of CSS, Javascript, and golang are nice (but not required)

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come away with?
Determine if Dark is useful for you to use as a programming language.
